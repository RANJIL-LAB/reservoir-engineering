st.markdown("""
This tool solves the **Material Balance Equation (MBE)** — a formula petroleum
engineers use to understand what's happening inside an oil or gas reservoir.

You give it numbers (production volumes, pressures, fluid properties), and it
calculates the one number you don't know. It can tell you:

- **N** — How much oil was originally underground
- **We** — How much water has flowed in from the aquifer
- **m** — How big the gas cap is, relative to the oil zone
- **deltaP** — How much the pressure dropped
- **G** — How much gas was originally underground

To launch the app, open a terminal and run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your browser opens to `http://localhost:8501`. This page — the manual — lives at
`http://localhost:8501/docs`. The calculator itself is at the home page.

st.header("2. The Interface")

st.subheader("The Sidebar")

st.markdown("""
Open the app and look at the left sidebar. This is where you tell the tool
*what kind of reservoir* you have and *what you want to solve for*.

**Fluid Type**
Choose between **Oil Reservoir** and **Gas Reservoir**. This changes
everything — the equation, the variable list, and the drive options. Gas
reservoirs are simpler (fewer variables, fewer drive mechanisms).

**Target Variable**
The dropdown labeled *"What do you want to solve for?"* is the single unknown
the computer will calculate. For oil, you can pick **N**, **We**, **m**, or
**deltaP**. For gas, you can pick **G** or **We**.

**Reservoir State** (Oil only)
- **Saturated** — Pressure is at or below the bubble point. Gas is bubbling
  out of the oil. You'll need to enter gas-related variables like `Rp`, `Rsi`,
  `Bg`, `Bgi`.
- **Unsaturated** — Pressure is still above the bubble point. No free gas
  exists. The app automatically hides gas variables and sets `Rp = Rsi`.

**Drive Mechanisms**
Three checkboxes control which physical forces are active in your reservoir:

| Checkbox | When OFF |
|---|---|
| Water Drive Active? | Sets `We`, `Wp`, `Bw` to zero and hides them |
| Gas Cap Active? | Sets `m`, `Bgi` to zero and hides them |
| Rock & Water Expansion Active? | Sets `cw`, `cf`, `Swi`, `deltaP` to zero and hides them |

The smart-hiding behavior means you only see input boxes for variables that
actually matter for your scenario. No clutter, no confusion.

**The "Unsaturated" shortcut**
When you select *Unsaturated*, the app automatically forces `m = 0`, `Bg = 0`,
`Bgi = 0`, and `Rsi = 0` — then hides them all. This is the equivalent of
turning off the Gas Cap drive, since there's no free gas above the bubble
point.
""")

st.subheader("Data Input Area")

st.markdown("""
Below the sidebar header, you choose how to provide your numbers:

**Manual Entry**
Input boxes appear in two columns. Each box shows the variable name, its
description, and a sensible default value. The app automatically hides:

- The variable you're solving for (that's the unknown)
- Variables forced to zero by your drive mechanism choices

Only fill in what you see. If a variable is missing from the screen, the app
is handling it for you.

**File Upload (CSV/Excel)**
Drop a spreadsheet file to load data from columns. The app matches column
names to variables (case-insensitive — `np` and `Np` both work). Only the
first row is used for calculation; if your file has multiple rows, the app
also generates time-series charts (Pressure vs Np, Havlena-Odeh F vs Et).

Hit the big blue **Calculate** button when you're ready. If you arrived here
from a tutorial link, the calculation runs automatically.

*Goal: See how few inputs you need for an unsaturated reservoir.*

You have a tight oil reservoir above the bubble point. No gas cap, no water

The app hides every variable related to gas and water. You see only seven

# ── 4. Understanding the Results ────────────────────────────────────────────

st.header("4. Understanding the Results")

st.markdown("""
After clicking Calculate (or arriving from a tutorial link), the page scrolls
down to the Results section. Here's what you see, in order:

### The Big Answer
The solved variable is displayed in large blue text, with units.
For example: **N = 36,593,625.50 STB | 36.59 MMSTB**.

### Recovery Factor (Oil only)
If you solved for N (or provided it), the app shows what percentage of the
original oil you've produced: **Rf = (Np / N) × 100%**.

### Drive Mechanism Analysis
A plain-language description of what's pushing the oil (or gas) out:

| Mechanism | When it appears |
|---|---|
| Solution Gas Drive | m = 0 and We = 0 |
| Gas Cap Drive | m > 0 |
| Water Drive | Significant We |
| Combination Drive | Both m > 0 and significant We |
| Volumetric Depletion | Gas reservoir with We = 0 |

### Expert Insights
Context-sensitive warnings appear based on your numbers. For example:
- If `Rp > Rsi`, you're losing pressure energy through the wellbore
- If rock/fluid expansion is the only drive, expect very low recovery factor
- Trend analysis tip: plot N over time to verify your drive mechanism assumptions

### Drive Indices Pie Chart
A donut chart showing each mechanism's percentage contribution.
For oil, the four slices are:
1. Oil Shrinkage / Solution Gas
2. Gas Cap Expansion
3. Rock & Water Expansion
4. Net Water Influx

For gas, the two slices are:
1. Gas Expansion
2. Net Water Influx

st.subheader("The Material Balance Equation (Simplified)")

st.markdown("""
The MBE is a conservation law — what leaves the reservoir must be balanced by
what expands or flows in to fill the empty space.

For oil reservoirs, the full equation is:

```
N = (Np × [Bt + (Rp − Rsi) × Bg] − (We − Wp × Bw))
    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    (Bt − Bti) + m × Bti × [Bg/Bgi − 1] + Bti × (1+m) × [(Swi×cw+cf)/(1−Swi)] × deltaP
```

**Top (numerator):** Everything that came out of the reservoir minus what came in.
- `Np × Bt` — produced oil, converted to reservoir volume
- `Np × (Rp − Rsi) × Bg` — extra gas that bubbled out as pressure dropped
- `We − Wp × Bw` — net water (aquifer inflow minus produced water)

**Bottom (denominator):** How much space was created underground by expansion.
- `(Bt − Bti)` — oil itself expanded
- `m × Bti × (Bg/Bgi − 1)` — gas cap expanded
- `Bti × (1+m) × [...] × deltaP` — rock and water squeezed

For gas reservoirs, the equation is simpler:

```
G × (Bg − Bgi) = Gp × Bg − (We − Wp × Bw)
```

You don't need to memorize these. The app handles the math. The important
thing is understanding which terms correspond to which drive mechanisms,
so you know which checkboxes to turn on or off.

The Havlena-Odeh method rearranges the MBE into a straight-line form:

**F = N × Et**

Where:
- **F** = everything produced (oil, gas, water)
- **Et** = everything that expanded (oil, gas cap, rock, water)

When you upload a CSV with multiple rows (one per time step), the app plots
F vs Et. A straight line through the origin confirms your drive mechanism
assumptions are correct. The slope of the line is **N**.

- **Straight line** — your m and We assumptions are correct
- **Curves upward** — you're missing an energy source (try a larger m or We)
- **Curves downward** — you're overestimating the energy

1. **Start with the tutorials above.** Each one loads a working example with

2. **Turn off drives you don't need.** Unsure about water influx? Uncheck
   Water Drive. The app zeros it out and hides the relevant input boxes.

3. **The pie chart is your diagnostic tool.** If you expected "Water Drive"
   but the chart shows 100% "Solution Gas Drive," your We value is probably
   wrong or missing.

4. **CSV column names are case-insensitive.** Upload a file with columns
